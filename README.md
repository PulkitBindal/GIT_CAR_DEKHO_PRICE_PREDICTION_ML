## GIT_CAR_PRICE_PREDICTION_ML

## ABSTRACT
In this paper, we investigate the application of supervised machine learning techniques to predict the price of used cars in Mauritius. The predictions are based on 
historical data collected from daily newspapers. Different techniques like multiple linear regression analysis, k-nearest neighbours, na√Øve bayes and decision trees 
have been used to make the predictions. The predictions are then evaluated and compared in order to find those which provide the best performances.

## INTRODUCTION
Predicting the price of used cars in both an important and interesting problem.According to data obtained from the National Transport Authority , the number of cars 
registered between 2003 and 2013 has witnessed a spectacular increase of 234%. From 68, 524 cars registered in 2003, this number has now reached 160, 701. With 
difficult economic conditions, it is likely that sales of second-hand imported (reconditioned) cars and used cars will increase. It is reported in [2] that the sales 
of new cars has registered a decrease of 8% in 2013.

## THE PROBLEM

a new car can be assured of the money they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of customers to buy new cars due to 
the lack of fund or due to various personal reasons.
