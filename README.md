## GIT_CAR_PRICE_PREDICTION_ML

## ABSTRACT
In this paper, we investigate the application of supervised machine learning
techniques to predict the price of used cars in Mauritius. The predictions are
based on historical data collected from daily newspapers. Different techniques
like multiple linear regression analysis, k-nearest neighbours, na√Øve bayes and
decision trees have been used to make the predictions. The predictions are
then evaluated and compared in order to find those which provide the best
performances.


## INTRODUCTION
Predicting the price of used cars in both an important and interesting problem.
According to data obtained from the National Transport Authority [1], the number of
cars registered between 2003 and 2013 has witnessed a spectacular increase of 234%.
From 68, 524 cars registered in 2003, this number has now reached 160, 701. With
difficult economic conditions, it is likely that sales of second-hand imported
(reconditioned) cars and used cars will increase. It is reported in [2] that the sales of
new cars has registered a decrease of 8% in 2013.
